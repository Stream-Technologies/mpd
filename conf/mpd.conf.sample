#	MPD configuration file
#
# This file defines the configuration for mpd: what the
# bundles are, what the links are in those bundles, how
# the interface should be configured, various PPP parameters,
# etc. It contains commands just as you would type them
# in at the console. Lines without padding are labels. Lines
# starting with a "#" are comments.

default:

dialup:
#
# Example of a simple PPP dialup account using "usr" modem device.
# This will connect whenever there is outgoing demand (DoD), and hangup
# after a 15 minute idle time. It also connects and disconnects
# when signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are received, respectively.
#
# Note the "set iface addrs ..." is needed because we're doing
# dial-on-demand and therefore can't wait for the peer to assign
# us IP addresses for the interface. These can be completely phoney
# IP addresses.
#
# We also enable the idle-script "Ringback", which means if we're
# not connected and we detect an incoming call, we don't answer it
# BUT we do initiate a call to the ISP to get connected. This is
# nice to connect yourself when you're away from home, etc.
