  <sect><heading>PPPoE device type commands<label id="pppoe"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to PPPoE type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>pppoe</bf>.

  Right now the PPPoE layer only works in client mode. That is,
  you can connect to a PPPoE server, but cannot act as a server yet.
  Also, your kernel must be compiled with ``options NETGRAPH'' to
  netgraph-enable the Ethernet interfaces (if your system is new enough
  to have the <tt>/modules/ng_ether.ko</tt> KLD installed, then
  this is no longer true; you only need load the KLD).

  PPPoE requires two pieces of configuration information: the name
  of the Ethernet interface to use, and a service name, which should
  be supplied by your ISP. If you do not have a service name, then
  the empty string (the default) often suffices.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set pppoe iface <em>interface-name</em>
</tt></tag>

Set the name of the Ethernet interface to use. PPPoE does
not affect normal use of the interface.

<tag><tt>
set pppoe service <em>service-name</em>
</tt></tag>

Sets the requested PPPoE service name.
