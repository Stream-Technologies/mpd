  <sect><heading>PPPoE device type commands<label id="pppoe"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to PPPoE type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>pppoe</bf>.

  Your kernel must be compiled with ``options NETGRAPH'' to
  netgraph-enable the Ethernet interfaces (if your system is new enough
  to have the <tt>/modules/ng_ether.ko</tt> KLD installed, then
  this is no longer true; you only need load this KLD).

  PPPoE requires two pieces of configuration information: the name
  of the Ethernet interface to use, and a service name, which should
  be supplied by your ISP. If you do not have a service name, then
  the empty string (the default) often suffices.

  <p>
  <bf>Note:</bf> There is a bug in Windows 2000 PPPoE implementation
  which makes connection impossible due to LCP mru negotiation failure.
  Other Windows version have no this bug.

<tag><tt>
set pppoe iface <em>interface-name</em>
</tt></tag>

Set the name of the Ethernet interface to use. PPPoE does
not affect normal use of the interface.

<tag><tt>
set pppoe service <em>service-name</em>
</tt></tag>

Sets the requested PPPoE service name. Setting service name to "*" 
on link with allowed incoming connections allows to accept incoming 
connection requests with any service name specified.

<tag><tt>
set pppoe acname <em>name</em>
</tt></tag>

Set name of this PPPoE access concentrator to be sent to clients.
If not specified, local hostname will be used.
