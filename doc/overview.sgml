      <p>
	Mpd is a netgraph(4) based implementation of the multi-link
	PPP protocol for FreeBSD.  It is designed to be both fast
	and flexible.  It handles configuration and negotiation in
	user land, while routing all data packets strictly in the
	kernel.  It supports several of the numerous PPP sub-protocols
	and extensions, such as:
	<itemize>
	<item>Multi-link PPP capability
	<item>PAP, CHAP, and MS-CHAP authentication
	<item>DES and MPPE encryption
	<item>Stac<bf>*</bf>, and MPPC<bf>*</bf> compression
	<item>Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol (PPTP)
	</itemize>
	Mpd also includes many additional features:
	<itemize>
	<item>Dial-on-demand with idle timeout
	<item>Multiple active connections running simultaneously
	<item>Dynamic demand based link management
		(also known as ``rubber bandwidth'')
	<item>Powerful chat scripting language for asynchronous serial ports
	<item>Pre-tested chat scripts for automatic configuration
		of several common modems and ISDN terminal adapters
	<item>Support for the

	<item>Support for tunnelling PPP over TCP, UDP, and PPTP
	<item>Clean device-type independent design
	<item>Comprehensive logging
	</itemize>
	Mpd supports the following device types:
	<itemize>
	<item><bf>Modem.</bf> The modem device type supports
	asychronous serial connections, including modems,
	ISDN terminal adapters, and null-modem connections.
	Mpd includes a fully
	event-driven scripting language for modem identification,
	setup, manual server login, etc.

	Netgraph is highly modular kernel networking system,
	supporting synchronous serial
	connections, Cisco HDLC, Frame Relay, and other protocols.
	Mpd supports running PPP over any netgraph connection.
	<item><bf>TCP.</bf> Mpd can tunnel PPP frames over a TCP connection.
	Frames are encoded in the same was as asychronous serial connections.
	<item><bf>UDP.</bf> Mpd can tunnel PPP frames over a UDP connection.
	Each frame is encapsulated in a UDP datagram packet.
	<item><bf>PPTP.</bf> Mpd can connect over the Internet using
	the Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol (PPTP).
	This protocol is supported by the popular Microsoft Dial-Up
	Networking client.
	<item><bf>PPPoE.</bf> Mpd can connect over an Ethernet port
	using the PPP-over-Ethernet (PPPoE) protocol.
	</itemize>

      <p>
	Mpd was originally developed at
	<htmlurl url="http://www.whistle.com" name="Whistle Communications">
	for use in the
	<htmlurl url="http://www.whistle.com" name="Whistle InterJet">.
	It is based on the original <tt>iij-ppp</tt> user-mode PPP code,
	though it has pretty much been completely rewritten since then.

      <p>
	<bf>*</bf> These protocols require source files that
	  are proprietary and/or export-controlled and cannot be
	  included in the normal distribution. For MPPC, you need
	  proprietary compression from Hi/Fn (formerly Stac).
	  DES encryption support requires the <tt>libdes</tt> library.
