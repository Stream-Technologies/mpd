<p>

  This chapter describes general mpd commands that don't
  apply to a specific layer.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>bundle [ <em>name</em> ] </tt>
</tag>

This command changes the currenly active bundle to the bundle named
<tt><em>name</em></tt>. The currently active link is also
changed, to the first link defined the bundle. If no
<tt><em>name</em></tt> is given, this command lists all
of the defined bundles and their constituent links.
The new bundle will be reflected in the prompt.

<tag><tt>link <em>name</em></tt>
</tag>

This command changes the currenly active link to the link named
<tt><em>name</em></tt>. If this link does not belong to
the currently active bundle, then the currently active bundle
is changed to the bundle that owns link <tt><em>name</em></tt>.
The new link will be reflected in the prompt.

<tag><tt>load <em>configuration</em></tt>
</tag>

This command causes mpd to read the entry for
<tt><em>configuration</em></tt> out of <tt>mpd.conf</tt> and
execute the corresponding commands, just
as if <tt><em>configuration</em></tt> had been specified on the command line.
Execution stops at the first blank line.

<tag><tt>show [ <em>item</em> ] </tt>
</tag>

This command displays various status information. The valid
values for <tt><em>item</em></tt> are:

<descrip>

<tag>bundle</tag>
Show status information about the currently active bundle.
<tag>link</tag>
Show status information about the currently active link.
<tag>iface</tag>
Show status information about the interface layer associated
with the currently active bundle.
<tag>routes</tag>
Show the current IP routing table.
<tag>mp</tag>
Show status information about the multi-link
protocol associated with the currently active bundle.
<tag>ipcp</tag>
Show status information about the IP control
protocol associated with the currently active bundle.

Show all pending events (for debugging mpd).
<tag>mem</tag>
Show distribution of dynamically allocated memory (for debugging mpd).
<tag>version</tag>

</descrip>

<tag><tt>open [ <em>layer</em> ] </tt>
</tag>

This command causes an OPEN event to be sent to the corresponding
layer or finite state machine (FSM). The valid layers are:

<descrip>
<tag>iface</tag>

Interface layer. Opening this layer configures the interface and
installs any routes. If dial-on-demand is enabled, nothing else
happens until there is outgoing traffic. Otherwise, the lower layers
are opened as well in order to establish a connection.

<tag>bund</tag>
Bundle layer. This layer represents the multi-link bundle ``virtual
link'' and is normally opened and closed automatically by the
interface layer.

<tag>ipcp</tag>

IP control protocol FSM. This is normally opened and closed automatically.

<tag>ccp</tag>

Compression control protocol FSM.
This is normally opened and closed automatically.

<tag>lcp</tag>

Link control protocol FSM.
This is normally opened and closed automatically.

<tag>phys</tag>

Device layer.
This is normally opened and closed automatically.

</descrip>

Normally, only the <tt>iface</tt> layer should be explicitly
opened or closed. This is because the other layers are programmed
to automatically open and close when appropriate. Note that
the <bf>SIGUSR1</bf> and <bf>SIGUSR2</bf> signals are an alternative
way to open and close the currently active bundle.

<tag><tt>close [ <em>layer</em> ] </tt>
</tag>

This command causes a CLOSE event to be sent to the corresponding
layer or finite state machine (FSM).

<tag><tt>log [ <em>+/-flag ...</em> ] </tt>
</tag>

Mpd supports several different logging flags. Every line logged by mpd is
tagged with one (or more) of these flags. By turning the flags on or off,
that particular type of logging is enabled or disabled. This allows you
to customize logging verbosity.

Without any arguments, the <tt>log</tt> command shows the current
set of logging flags.
To enable a logging flag, add the <tt>+<em>flag</em></tt> argument.
To disable a logging flag, add the <tt>-<em>flag</em></tt> argument.

These are the various flags supported by mpd and their corresponding
categories. Those with a * are turned on by default:

<descrip>
<tag>auth*</tag>	Link authentication events
<tag>bund*</tag>	Bundle layer events
<tag>ccp</tag>		Compression events and negotiation
<tag>ccp2</tag>		Compression more verbosity
<tag>ccp3</tag>		Compression even more verbosity
<tag>chat*</tag>	Modem chat script
<tag>chat2</tag>	Modem chat script more verbosity. Very useful when
			debugging chat scripts.
<tag>console*</tag>	Log to the console as well as the log file
<tag>echo</tag>		Echo/reply packets for all FSM's
<tag>frame</tag>	Dump all frames transmitted and received
<tag>fsm*</tag>		All FSM events (except echo and resets)
<tag>iface*</tag>	Interface layer events
<tag>ipcp*</tag>	IP control protocol events and negotiation
<tag>lcp*</tag>		Link control protocol events and negotiation
<tag>link*</tag>	Link layer events
<tag>mp</tag>		Multi-link events and negotiation
<tag>mp2</tag>		Multi-link more verbosity
<tag>phys*</tag>	Device layer events
<tag>pptp*</tag>	PPTP device layer high level events
<tag>pptp2</tag>	PPTP more verbosity
<tag>pptp3</tag>	PPTP even more verbosity
<tag>radius*</tag>	RADIUS authentication events
</descrip>

<tag><tt>help [ <em>command</em> ] </tt>
</tag>

This gives a brief description of the supplied command, or if
an incomplete command is given, lists the available alternatives.

<tag><tt>null</tt>
</tag>

This command does nothing.

<tag><tt>exit</tt>
</tag>

This command exits the console, but does not quit the mpd process.
This command is useful for disconnecting a telnet connection.

<tag><tt>quit</tt>
</tag>

Close down all connections and quit the mpd process.

</descrip>
