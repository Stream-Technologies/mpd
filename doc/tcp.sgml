  <sect><heading>TCP device type commands<label id="tcp"></heading>

  <p>
  <bf>Note:</bf> The TCP device type is currently broken and will
  not compile (it needs to be updated to support netgraph).

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to TCP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>tcp</bf>.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set tcp mode [ <em>active</em> | <em>passive</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Set the link for active or passive mode. In active mode, the local
side initiates all connections. In passive mode, the local side
waits for incoming connections (in a future revision bi-directional
connections will be supported).

<tag><tt>
set tcp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the TCP connection.
If none is specified, any suitable local IP address is used.

<tag><tt>
set tcp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the TCP connection.
If none is specified, any peer may connect to us.
