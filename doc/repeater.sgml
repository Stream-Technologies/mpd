  <sect><heading>Repeater layer commands<label id="repeater"></heading>

<p>

  This chapter describes commands that configure the repeater layer.
  All of these commands (except <bf><tt>rnew</tt></bf>)
  apply to the currently active repeater.
  
  Repeater repeats all connections, coming from one physical device, 
  to another without any processing. This technology is also known as 
  LAC (L2TP Access Concentrator) and PAC (PPTP Access Concentrator).
  
  For correct operation one device should be configured for accepting 
  incoming connections while another for making outgoing connections.

<tag><tt>rnew </tt> <tt><em>name</em> <em>phys1</em> <em>phys2</em> </tt>
</tag>

This command creates a new repeater named <tt><em>name</em></tt>.

Two physical devices that constitute the repeater are created and named
<tt><em>phys1</em></tt> and <tt><em>phys2</em></tt>.  For each
physical device, there must be a corresponding entry with the same name (i.e.,
label) in <tt>mpd.links</tt>. This entry must at the very least
define the type of the physical device (via the <tt>set phys type ...</tt> command).
