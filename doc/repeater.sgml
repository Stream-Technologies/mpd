<p>

  This chapter describes commands that configure the repeater layer.
  All of these commands apply to the currently active repeater.
  
  Repeater repeats all connections, coming from one physical device, 
  to another without any processing. This technology is also known as 
  LAC (L2TP Access Concentrator) and PAC (PPTP Access Concentrator).
  
  For correct operation one device should be configured for accepting 
  incoming connections while another for making outgoing connections.
