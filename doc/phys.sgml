  <sect><heading>Phys layer commands<label id="phys"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that configure the physical device layer.
  All of these commands apply to the currently active physical device, i.e.,
  the physical device shown at the command line prompt.

  These are only the type-independent commands.
  To configure properties specific to a particular physical device type,
  see the chapter describing that type.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set phys type <em>type</em>
</tt></tag>

This command tells mpd what the type for this physical device is.
This should generally be the first command in the
<tt>mpd.links</tt> entry for each physical device.
