  <sect><heading>Change history<label id="changes"></heading>

  <p>
    Changes since version 3.7:
    <itemize>
    <item>Now setting <tt>max-redial</tt> to -1 means mpd will never redial.
	This is useful for dial-in servers.
    </item>
    <item>Increased the default <tt>FD_SETSIZE</tt> to 2048 so we can
	handle lots of bundles, and made it compile-time adjustable.
    </item>
    <item>Allow multiple PPTP connections from the same IP address
	when this is OK to do (no explicit peer IP addresses configured).
	This allows multiple incoming connections through a remote NAT device.
    </item>
    <item>Added support for 56-bit MPPE encryption.
    </item>
    <item>Allow the inner and outer PPTP IP addresses to be the same,
	relying on the kernel to return an error if it needs to.
	This reverts the change put into version 3.3.
    </item>
    <item>Fixed bug in MTU calculation when doing MPPC/MPPE.
    </item>
    <item>Added the <tt>set pptp phonenum <em>number</em></tt> command.
    </item>
    <item>Added documentation for the <tt>delayed-ack</tt>
	and <tt>always-ack</tt> PPTP device configuration options.
    </item>
    <item>Minor tweaks to the sample config files.
    </item>
    </itemize>
  </p>

  <p>
    Changes since version 3.6:
    <itemize>
    <item>Fix a bug where the MPPE keys were being incorrectly generated
	when MS-CHAP was used to authenticate in both directions.
    </item>
    </itemize>
  </p>

  <p>
    Changes since version 3.5:
    <itemize>
    <item>Fix MS-CHAPv2 acknowledge reply to workaround Win9x bug when
	trying to negotiate MPPE encryption.
    </item>
    </itemize>
  </p>

  <p>
    Changes since version 3.4:
    <itemize>
    <item>Fix an install problem on FreeBSD-current.
    </item>
    <item>Display the peer's authname and EID in ``show bundle'' command.
    </item>
    </itemize>
  </p>

  <p>
    Changes since version 3.3:
    <itemize>
    <item>Support for MS-CHAPv2 when we are the server.
	Always request MS-CHAPv2 first, then accept MS-CHAPv1
	if the peer requests that instead.
    </item>
    <item>Fix for possible core dump in ECP code.
    </item>
    <item>Fix for bug in event library when an invalid file
	descriptor is passed.
    </item>
    <item>Disallow allow PPTP peer inside and outside IP addresses
	from being the same; we know this won't work.
    </item>
    <item>Fixed bug in PAP code where the PAP response packet would
	be improperly formatted.
    <item>Accept EINPROGRESS error from ng_ksocket connect message.
	This happens on FreeBSD-current for some reason.
    </item>
    <item>Accept PPTP messages with non-zero values in reserved
	fields. They violate the specification but some peers
	send them anyway.
    </item>
    <item>Remove bogus extra field in definition of PPTP StopCtrlConnReply.
    </item>
    </itemize>
  </p>

  <p>
    Changes since version 3.2:
    <itemize>
    <item>There is no longer a fixed limit to the number of
	bundles and/or links that may be created.
    </item>
    <item>Better random number generation using <tt>srandomdev(4)</tt>.
    </item>
    <item>Miscellaneous minor bug fixes.
    </item>
    <item>
	Support for authenticating to the peer using Microsoft CHAP Version 2
	has been added.
    <bf>Note:</bf>
	When authenticating the peer, only Version 1 is requested.
    </item>
    <item>Hostnames are allowed in the configuration files.
    </item>
    </itemize>

  The latter two are thanks to Franco Venturi
