  <sect><heading>L2TP device type commands<label id="l2tp"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to L2TP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>l2tp</bf>.

  The L2TP protocol utilizes UDP datagrams on port 1701 (and this is 
  the default for <tt><em>port</em></tt> in the commands below) 
  to create and maintain virtual tunnel between IP peers. 
  One or more independent PPP connections (sessions) can be 
  carried inside this tunnel.

  Windows client uses IPSec encryption for the additional tunnel 
  security. So, to let it connect you must configure IPSec on your 
  MPD router or disable IPSec on Windows by setting registry 
  DWORD value ProhibitIpSec at the key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters\
  into "1".

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set l2tp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the L2TP connection.
There is known implementation bug if this option is not set 
while accepting incoming connections on the router with multiple 
IPs and clients are connecting not to the nearest address of 
this router.

<tag><tt>
set l2tp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the L2TP connection.
This command applies to both incoming and outgoing connections.
For outgoing connections, this command is required in order to
specify where to connect to. For incoming connections, this command
is optional; if not given, mpd accepts incoming connections from any
host. Otherwise, only connections from the stated IP address
(and, optionally, port) are allowed.

<tag><tt>
set l2tp callingnum <em>number</em>
</tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>
set l2tp callednum <em>number</em>
</tt></tag>

Sets the calling and called telephone number to use when initiating a L2TP
connection. For most VPN applications this is ignored, but in certain
cases an actual phone number is required.
The default is the empty string.

<tag><tt>set l2tp enable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set l2tp disable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>

Enable and disable L2TP device type options for the link.

<p>
The following options are supported:

<descrip>

<tag><tt>originate</tt></tag>

This option enables the initiation of L2TP connections to the peer.
If this option is disabled, mpd will not initiate any L2TP connections.
You must configure the peer's IP address with the
<tt><bf>set l2tp peer</bf></tt> command.

<tag><tt>incoming</tt></tag>

This option enables the acceptance of incoming L2TP connections.
If this option is disabled, mpd will not accept any incoming connections.

<tag><tt>outcall</tt></tag>

In L2TP, each individual PPP connection between two IP hosts (there
may be several), is initiated as either an incoming or an outgoing call. 
This is to allow, for example, making an actual outgoing telephone call via
a remote access server, as well as the more common use of forwarding
of an incoming telephone call from an access server to a remote
L2TP server.

When this option is enabled, mpd will initiate outgoing calls;
otherwise mpd will initiate incoming calls.
