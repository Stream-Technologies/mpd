  <sect><heading>L2TP device type commands<label id="l2tp"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to L2TP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>l2tp</bf>.

  The L2TP protocol can be most easily understood as just another
  link layer type, where the link layer medium just happens to be
  an IP connection. So, for example, instead of configuring a
  telephone number to dial as you would with a modem, you configure
  an IP address to connect to. Everything else that's above the
  link layer functions exactly the same. Hence L2TP allows you
  to ``tunnel'' PPP frames over IP.

  Note that L2TP connections are initiated by a UDP connection from
  one machine to another, and that servers usually listen to UDP
  port 1701 (and this is the default for <tt><em>port</em></tt>
  in the commands below).

<descrip>

<tag><tt>
set l2tp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the L2TP connection.

<tag><tt>
set l2tp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the L2TP connection.
This command applies to both incoming and outgoing connections.
For outgoing connections, this command is required in order to
specify where to connect to. For incoming connections, this command
is optional; if not given, mpd accepts incoming connections from any
host. Otherwise, only connections from the stated IP address
(and, optionally, port) are allowed.

<tag><tt>
set l2tp callingnum <em>number</em>
</tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>
set l2tp callednum <em>number</em>
</tt></tag>

Sets the calling and called telephone number to use when initiating a L2TP
connection. For most VPN applications this is ignored, but in certain
cases an actual phone number is required.
The default is the empty string.

<tag><tt>set l2tp enable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set l2tp disable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>

Enable and disable L2TP device type options for the link.

</descrip>

<p>
The following options are supported:

<descrip>

<tag><tt>originate</tt></tag>

This option enables the initiation of L2TP connections to the peer.
If this option is disabled, mpd will not initiate any L2TP connections.
You must configure the peer's IP address with the
<tt><bf>set l2tp peer</bf></tt> command.

<tag><tt>incoming</tt></tag>

This option enables the acceptance of incoming L2TP connections.
If this option is disabled, mpd will not accept any incoming connections.

<tag><tt>outcall</tt></tag>

In L2TP, each individual PPP connection between two IP hosts (there
may be several), is initiated as either an incoming or an outgoing call. 
This is to allow, for example, making an actual outgoing telephone call via
a remote access server, as well as the more common use of forwarding
of an incoming telephone call from an access server to a remote
L2TP server.

When this option is enabled, mpd will initiate outgoing calls;
otherwise mpd will initiate incoming calls.
