  <sect><heading>Installing mpd<label id="installing"></heading>

  <p>
	If you use the FreeBSD package or port, mpd will be
	automatically installed
	into <tt>/usr/local/sbin/mpd5</tt>.
	with the default set of device types compiled into it.
	In order to run, mpd needs
	a few configuration files. The directory
	<tt>/usr/local/etc/mpd5</tt> is created
	to hold them.
	In it you will find some sample configuration files.
</p>

<p>
	Before you can run mpd, you must set up your site-specific
	configuration files. These files are:
	<descrip>

	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.conf</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file defines one or more <bf>configurations</bf>.
	When mpd is invoked, you specify the name of a
	configuration on the command line. This configuration
	(which merely consists of a series of mpd commands) is loaded.
	If no configuration
	is given, the first one listed in <tt>mpd.conf</tt>
	is loaded.
</p>

<p>
	Each configuration defines one or more bundles. Each bundle
	is given a name, assigned a system interface and one or
	more links that make up the bundle.
	A bundle
	is defined with the <bf><tt>new</tt></bf> command.
	Subsequent commands in the configuration configure the various
	layers for that bundle.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking, the commands in <tt>mpd.conf</tt> only
	configure the device independent information for a bundle.
</p>

	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.links</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file contains definitions of the various links that
	are available on the system. Different links may be part
	of different bundles in different configurations. Therefore,
	the commands in this file configure information that is
	link specific and independent of any particular configuration.
	For example, a certain modem may require a special init string,
	no matter how or in what bundle the modem is to be used.
	The commands in this file are executed when the bundle 
	is defined (i.e., as a result of a <bf><tt>new</tt></bf>
	command). So the information configured for a link by that
	link's <tt>mpd.links</tt> entry can be overriden by subsequent
	commands in <tt>mpd.conf</tt>.
</p>


	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.secret</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file contains login, password pairs. This is where
	mpd looks to find all authentication information. This
	file should be readable only by <tt>root</tt>.
</p>

	<tag> <bf><tt>mpd.script</tt></bf>

<p>
	This file contains chat scripts for modem devices.
</p>

	</descrip>
