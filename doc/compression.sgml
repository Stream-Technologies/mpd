  <sect><heading>Compression layer commands<label id="compression"></heading>

  <p>

  This chapter describes commands that configure the Compression Control
  Protocol (CCP) layer. All of these commands apply to the currently
  active bundle.
  <p>
  To use CCP you should enable compression at the bundle level.
  To allow compression to be negotiated you should enable here some of 
  compression protocols.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>set ccp accept <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ccp deny <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ccp enable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ccp disable <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ccp yes <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>
<tag><tt>set ccp no <em>option ...</em> </tt></tag><p>

These commands configure various CCP options. Each direction of
traffic (transmit and receive) is independent from the other.
All options default to <tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt>.

The <tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> commands determine
whether we desire the corresponding option on received data.
The <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt> commands determine
whether we will allow the peer to request the corresponding option
(which we must enable on our transmitted data).

<p>
The <bf><tt>yes</tt></bf> command is the same as
<tt><bf>enable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>accept</bf></tt>.
The <bf><tt>no</tt></bf> command is the same as
<tt><bf>disable</bf></tt> and <tt><bf>deny</bf></tt>.

</descrip>

<p>
The options available at the CCP layer are listed below. Note that
the STAC and MPPC options require proprietary files
that are not included with the normal mpd distribution.

<descrip>

<tag><tt>pred1</tt></tag>

This option enables Predictor-1 (RFC 1978) compression.
Predictor-1 compression is much faster then Deflate.
<P>
This option require ng_pred1 Netgraph node type, which is present
since FreeBSD 6.2-STABLE of 2006-01-28.
If there no ng_pred1 in system, this algorithm is supported
in user-level, but will consume more CPU power. To reduce packet 
loss in user-level on fast links it is recommended to increase 
values of net.graph.recvspace and net.graph.maxdgram sysctl variables.

<tag><tt>deflate</tt></tag>

This option enables Deflate (RFC 1979) compression.
Deflate compression usually gives better compression ratio then Predictor-1.
<P>
This option require ng_deflate Netgraph node type, which is present
since FreeBSD 6.2-STABLE of 2006-01-28.

<tag><tt>mppc</tt></tag>

This option is required in order to enable the
Microsoft Point-to-point compression (MPPC) and/or
Microsoft Point-to-point encryption (MPPE) protocols.
However, this option does not actually enable MPPC or MPPE;
you must use additional options (below) for that.

This option is required because of the way Microsoft implemented MPPC and
MPPE as additional, optional sub-components of the MPPC protocol.

Note: in order for MPPE to work, MS-CHAPv1 or MS-CHAPv2 is
mandatory, because the MPPE keys are generated using the results
from authentication.

<tag><tt>mpp-compress</tt></tag>

Enables MPPC compression. This is the only compression method supported by 
Microsoft Windows RAS.
<P>
This option requires compression support from ng_mppc node which is 
usually not implemented as it require some Hi/Fn proprietary files.

<tag><tt>mpp-e40</tt></tag>

Enables 40-bit MPPE encryption.

<tag><tt>mpp-e56</tt></tag>

Enables 56-bit MPPE encryption.
Note: 56 bit MPPE encryption is only supported in FreeBSD 4.5 or later.

<tag><tt>mpp-e128</tt></tag>

Enables 128-bit MPPE encryption.

<tag><tt>mpp-stateless</tt></tag>

Enables stateless mode. This mode requires slightly more CPU time
and is somewhat less secure, but allows faster recovery in the face
of dropped packets.

<tag><tt>mppe-policy</tt></tag>

If enabled, Mpd uses the MPPE-Types and MPPE-Policy info from the authentication 
backend.

Default <tt><bf>disable</bf></tt>.
