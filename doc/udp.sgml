  <sect><heading>UDP device type commands<label id="udp"></heading>

  <p>
  This chapter describes commands that are specific to UDP type links.
  These commands apply to the currently active link, and are only
  valid if the currently active link has type <bf>udp</bf>.
  It is suggested that the <tt>set iface mtu</tt> command be used
  when this link type is in use to avoid IP fragmentation.

  <p>
  <bf>Note:</bf> Technically this device type is broken, because
  PPP links are not allowed to re-order frames, yet UDP packets can
  be delivered out of order. Therefore, if you use this link type you
  should not enable multi-link PPP, PPP encryption, or PPP compression.
  Otherwise, out of order frames will be dropped, leading to performance
  degradation.

<tag><tt>
set udp self <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the local IP address and port for the UDP connection.
If none is specified, any suitable local IP address is used.

<tag><tt>
set udp peer <em>ipaddr</em> [ <em>port</em> ]
</tt></tag>

Sets the peer IP address and port for the UDP connection.
If none is specified, any peer may talk to us.

<tag><tt>
set udp origination local
<newline>set udp origination remote
</tt></tag>

This command is only required if MPPE encryption is used on the bundle.
MPPE requires knowledge of which peer ``originated'' the connection
and which peer ``answered'' the connection. Since UDP is connectionless,
there's no way for mpd to determine this reliably. Therefore one peer
must be configured with <tt>local</tt> origination and the other with
with <tt>remote</tt> origination. The default is unknown.
