<p>
A list of open tasks for MPD. This is a good startpoint if you
wan't to support actively the development of MPD. After completing
a task post it to MPD's maling list.

<descrip>

<tag>callback (client & server)</tag>
<p>
Currently MPD doesen't support callback, but it should.
</p>

<tag>NAT</tag>
<p>
Mpd has currently no support for NAT, but it would be great, if he
can support this. We intend not simply using libalias for this,
instead a new netgraph node ng_nat would be the right way for doing
this.
</p>

<tag>Unimplemented Protocols</tag>
<p>
lcp.c contains a list of protocols (gLcpConfOpts), each protocol with
"false" is not implemented.
